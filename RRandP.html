            Routers and Redundancy
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p1>
            Routers are used for transfering data and packets. These routers connect with each other and send data through each other to get to another place. These Transfers are usually not a direct transfer and they will pass through multiple routers to reach the destnation. This is so that when something with one router goes wrong everything can still fucntion. This is called redundancy. Redundency is important so that even if 400 routers stop working they can still transfer data.

        <h3>
            Packets
        </h3>
        <p1>
            Packets are like bundles of data sent form one place to another. These bundles of data can only hold a certain amount of information and usually multiple packets will be sent at once. Packets do not always arrive at the same time or the same order. Because of this the Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) was invented. This protocol numbers the packets so they can put them in the right order and ask for certain packets that were dropped to be sent again.
